### Resources
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging
    - I used this link as a refresher on tags and how to create a branch with a tag.
- http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp
    - I used this site to get names of colors that were recognized on all browsers.
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-commit--amend
    - I used this site to learn about amending commits when I noticed my commit for the article addition was missing. In the article it mentioned once a branch is pushed to a public repository to not amend the commit.

## Comments

When checking the requirements against my repository I noticed my commit for the article addition was missing. I distinctly remember writing a commit for this addition and noting the link it came from. When I think I have too many characters in my commits, I will copy the text and check the count in Word. I guess I somehow missed hitting enter on this particular commit because it isn't in my commit list. I searched online to see if there was a way to amend this but based on information in the article above it noted to not amend a commit that has been pushed to a public repository.

I felt much more comfortable completing this assignment compared to the last one. I think I might be a fan of jQuery!
